# Write a program that generates and prints 50 random integers, 
# each between 3 and 6.

# Write a program that generates a random number, x , between 1 and 50, a random number y
# between 2 and 5, and computes x y .

# print (x^y)


# ''' Question 5
# Write a program that generates 50 random numbers such that the first number is between 1 and 2, the second is between 1 and 3, the third is between 1 and 4, . . . , and the last is between
# 1 and 51.

# '''Question 6
# Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, x and y , and computes |xâˆ’ y|/x+ y .
# '''


# x= eval(input('Enter value for x '))
# y=eval(input('Enter value for y '))

# '''Question 3
#  Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and prints your name
#  that many times.
